# Datos - 7506

This repository will host all of the code I'll write for this class, except for whatever I write for the final project.
If that's what you are interested in, don't hesitate to contact me since that is hosted in a private repository.

Every data file is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime, so head there first if you plan on using this code.

As I said before, whatever I upload here is code that will be used to solve excercises, therefore, it may be sloppy since I don't plan on using it afterwards. Please take that into account.

Whatever you see here, feel free to use it, share it or laugh at it :D

See ya!
